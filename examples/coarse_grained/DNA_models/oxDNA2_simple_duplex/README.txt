This is a simple example demonstrating how to build a short straight
coarse-grained helical double-stranded DNA polymer
using the oxDNA2 force field with moltemplate.

This is based on the corresponding LAMMPS example located in this subdirectory:
examples/USER/cgdna/examples/oxDNA2/duplex1/
...which is distributed with LAMMPS.

WARNING: As of 2019-11-02, this example has not been tested or optimized.
         You should probably alter with the timestep, and langevin-settings
         to improve the simulation efficiency.

----
Note: If you get an error message (eg "Unknown pairstyle", "Unknown atom style")
      then you need to download the LAMMPS source code from git and
      compile LAMMPS with the following packages enabled:
             USER-CGDNA   ASPHERE
      See: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Build_package.html
           https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Build_cmake.html
       (or https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Build_make.html)

Instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.
