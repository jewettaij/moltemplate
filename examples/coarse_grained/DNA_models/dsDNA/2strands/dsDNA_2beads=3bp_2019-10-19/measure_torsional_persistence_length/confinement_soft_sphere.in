# This sets the parameter "rc0" equal to 200.0.
# The "200.0" means we assume no particle will ever be further than 200.0
# from the center of the sphere.  If you want Uexternal(r) = k*r^2,
# (proportional to r^2), then make sure that "rc0" equals the "rc" parameter.
# ("rc" is the 3rd argument in the "fix wall/region" command below.)



# Now apply an inward force applied to every particle.
# The energy of each particle (due to that force) is:
#
# Uexternal(r) = k*(rsurf-rc)^2
#       where "rsurf" = the distance from the particle to the surface = (rc0-r)
#              = k*((rc0-rc) - r)^2    (if (rc0-rc) < r < rc0,  0 otherwise)

# Try playing with the "k" value.


# In the specific case when rc0 = rc, this simplifies to:
#
# Uexternal(r) = k * r^2     (0 < r < rc0)
#
# This is like a simple spring (rest-length 0) that pulls every particle inward.
# The force is non-zero everywhere except at r=0
#    (and also r>rc0.  However rc0 is very big, so I ignore this possibility.)


# For (a very confusing) explanation of these commands go here:
# http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_wall_region.html
# http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/region.html
# (I had to figure things out by reading the source code, fix_wall_region.cpp)


# NOTES:

# This applies an inward force applied to every particle
# The energy of this interaction is Uexternal(r) = k*r^2    (r<rc, 0 otherwise)
#
# Because it is quadratic, the total energy can also be expressed this way:
#     \sum_i k*r_i^2  =  (k/(2N)) \sum_{i,j} (r_i - r_j)^2
#     (For details, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_gyration)
# ...where r_i and r_j are 3-D vectors representing positions of particles i & j
# ... and (r_i - r_j)^2 is the square of the distance between particles i and j
# ... assuming that "fix recenter" is used to keep the center of mass at 0
#     (in other words, assuming that \sum_i r_i = 0)
#      http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_recenter.html
#      Hmm.. Let's take care of that minor detail now:

fix fxCen all recenter 0 0 0

# Note: This can be interpreted as an attractive force between all PAIRS of 
#       particles.  The energy of interaction between each pair is
#        (k/2N) * (r_i - r_j)^2
#       where "k" is the parameter specified above in the "fix wall/region"
#       command





# ----
#  (scratchwork:  0.5*(1/(33.42335436886394**2)) = 4.475792428e-4)
#   This causes the root-mean-squared particle distance from the origin to be
#   33.42335436886394, which is the size of the inner sphere in "sphere.in")
