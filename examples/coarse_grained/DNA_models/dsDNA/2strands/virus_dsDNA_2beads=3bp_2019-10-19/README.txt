This is an example demonstrating how to confine a polymer (eg. DNA)
within an arbitrary shaped box (eg. the HIV viral capsid).

Initially, the conformation of the polymer is created with a combination
of "ndmansfield" (a random self-avoiding-curve generator), smoothed with
"interpolate_curve.py", and then re-scaled so that the spacing between points
along the curve matches the desired spacing between monomers in the polymer.
   (See "STEP_1_generate_coords.sh" for details.)

Then the "genpoly_lt.py" tool is used to create a moltemplate file
("dna_polymer.lt") which defines a polymer which lies along the curve
created in step 1 (see above).  The "genpoly_lt.py" program is explained here:
https://github.com/jewettaij/moltemplate/blob/master/doc/doc_genpoly_lt.md
Then moltemplate is invoked to create a LAMMPS data file and input script
containing the polymer (as well as the box that it is contained within).
   (See "STEP_2_generate_LAMMPS_files.sh" for details.)

Polymer Melts (Optional)

Note: In this example, there was only 1 polymer, but you can create a
system with multiple polymers (of various lengths) confined in the same box
by running the "genpoly_lt.py" script with the "-cuts" argument in step 2.
This is a useful way to generate polymer melts.

Biological Details (Optional)

This example uses the "dsDNA_2beads=3bp_2019-10-19" DNA model, which has
been tuned to have realistic geometry and mechanical properties of DNA,
including a major/minor groove, helicity, length, persistence length,
and torsional persistence length.

WARNING: THIS IS NOT A REALISTIC MODEL OF DNA IN THE HIV VIRUS FOR THESE REASONS

1) It is impossible to equilibrate a long confined polymer using this method.
The length of the simulation is insufficient for the polymer to reach
an equilibrium conformation.  At these concentrations, DNA is expected to
have much more ordered crystalline conformation.  In this short simulation,
the DNA remains bent and entangled with itself.  In order to simulate a
realistic confined DNA conformation, it may be necessary to use enhanced
sampling techniques and/or allow the polymer to pass through itself.
In LAMMPS the later can be done using any of the following pair styles:

http://moltemplate.org/lammps_code/pair_lj_charmm_coul_charmm_inter.html
 (Search for "soft-core".Â  Note: This feature requires you to recompile LAMMPS.)

2) In the real HIV virus, DNA is coated with a positively charged protein
("nucleocapsid") which helps compact the DNA.  DNA may also interact with a
different protein (integrase).  Both proteins have been left out of this model.

3) HIV is a retrovirus.  As of 2020-1-24, it is not yet certain whether
the HIV virus contains DNA during any stage of it's lifecycle.
It has been hypothesized the conversion of RNA to DNA in the capsid shell
causes it to burst.  The simulation has been set up to make it easy to
measure the outward force of the DNA on the capsid, however the lack of
nucleocapsid in the simulation makes this an unrealistic model.
(The nucleocapsid protein should reduce the outward pressure of the DNA
on the capsid shell.)

I realize this is a complicated example.
Hopefully in spite of that, this example is useful.
