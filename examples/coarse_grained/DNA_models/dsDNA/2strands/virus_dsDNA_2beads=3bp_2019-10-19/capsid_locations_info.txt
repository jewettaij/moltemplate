# This file was generated from the 3J3Q PDB file using this command:
#    ./CENTER_PDB.sh 3j3q_1vu4_A_biomt.pdb > NEW_FILE.pdb
# It requires a PDB file for the capsid containing BIOMT records.
# This will generate the "pdb_protein_center_locations.txt" file.
# (I discarded the NEW_FILE.pdb file in this case.  It wasn't needed.)
# Rename it to something more sensible and convert from Angstroms to nm (1/10).
# awk '{print $1/10" "$2/10" "$3/10}' < pdb_protein_center_locations.txt \
#                                     > capsid_locations.txt
#
# Note: Sometimes you get better results if you select a particular atom from
#       the protein (by editing the original PDB file to only include that atom)
#       I had best results using the CA atom from residue 173 or chain B
