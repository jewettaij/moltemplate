# Currently the polymer is in an unnatural and highly strained conformation.
# The purpose of this simulation is to continue relaxing the polymer so
# that we can run an ordinary simulation with a normal timestep.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#
# 1)   You must use moltemplate.sh to create 5 files:
#  system.data system.in.init system.in.settings system.in.types fix_twist.in
# 2)   You must run LAMMPS using the "run_min1.in" input script.
#  mpiexec -np 8 lmp_mpi -i run_min1.in

# -------- Init Section --------

# The forces between DNA strands depend on the salt concentration,
# so we must specify the salt concentration beforehand.
# We do this indirectly by specifying the Debye length.  Do this now.

variable debye_length equal 1.0

# Now read the settings which specify the force field styles we will use:
include system.in.init

# -------- Settings Section --------

include system.in.settings
include system.in.types
# extra settings for this simulation:
include fix_twist.in  # optional: turn on the torque in the twist motors
include confinement_hard_cylinder_R=450_K=10_Rmax=480.in # put it in a cylinder

# For extremely large simulations like this one, the default neighbor-list
# bin size and communication distance must be overridden to prevent LAMMPS from
# creating too many neighbor bins. (LAMMPS is currently not optimized for these
# kinds of huge simulations with extremely non-uniform density.)

                    # so we use a much smaller timestep than we normally would
                    # to avoid numerical instabilities.  (We will increase it
                    # later during the main simulation.)

# Initially give it a high temperature to jiggle it out
# of the unnatural conformation it is currently in.  Do not allow the
# simulation box to contract.  Simulate the DNA at constant temperature
# and volume.  We can use "fix nve/limit" for added numerical stability.
