This is a simple example demonstrating how to build a short straight
coarse-grained helical double-stranded (B-form) DNA polymer using the
oxDNA2 force field with moltemplate.

This is based on the corresponding LAMMPS example located in this subdirectory:
examples/USER/cgdna/examples/oxDNA2/duplex1/
...which is distributed with LAMMPS.  (The conversion into MOLTEMPLATE format
was done automatically using the "ltemplify.py" file converter.)

WARNING: As of 2020-11-20, this example has not been tested or optimized.
         You should probably alter with the timestep, and langevin-settings
         to improve the simulation efficiency.

----
Note: If you get an error message (eg "Unknown pairstyle", "Unknown atom style")
      then you need to download the LAMMPS source code from git and
      compile LAMMPS with the following packages enabled:
             USER-CGDNA   ASPHERE
      See: https://docs.lammps.org/Build_package.html
           https://docs.lammps.org/Build_cmake.html
       (or https://docs.lammps.org/Build_make.html)

Instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.
