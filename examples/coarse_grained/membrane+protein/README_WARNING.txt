WARNING:

   This is not a realistic simulation of proteins in a lipid membrane.  This
example was only intented to be a technical demonstration to show how to
combine totally different kinds of coarse-grained molecules (with different
kinds of force-fields) together in the same simulation in LAMMPS.  Tuning the
force-field parameters to get realistic results was not the goal.  I did
not take the extra time to do this.  If you have suggestions for changes,
please email me (jewett.aij at gmail dot com).
