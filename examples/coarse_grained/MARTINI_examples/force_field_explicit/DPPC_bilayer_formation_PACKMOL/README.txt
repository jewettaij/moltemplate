This example of the formation of a coarse-grained DPPC lipid-bilayer uses the
Martini force-field v2.0 (2013-10), was provided by Saeed Momeni Bashusqeh.
In this example, the initial coordinates are generated by PACKMOL.
If you prefer, there is also an example of a Martini DPPC bilayer
which has been preassembled using moltemplate commands.
(That example does not require PACKMOL.)
