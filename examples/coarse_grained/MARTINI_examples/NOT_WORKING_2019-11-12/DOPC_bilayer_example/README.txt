This example of the formation of a coarse-grained DOPC lipid-bilayer uses the
Martini force-field v2.0 (2013-10), was provided by Saeed Momeni Bashusqeh.
It's probably a good idea to run the simulation for a few ns to allow the
lipids to reorient themselves.

step 1)
To build the files which LAMMPS needs, follow the instructions in:
README_setup.sh

step 2)
To run LAMMPS with these files, follow these instructions:
README_run.sh

NOTE: We extracted the parameters in the MARTINI force field from the files
distributed with the "EMC" tool.  If you use these .lt files, please also cite:
