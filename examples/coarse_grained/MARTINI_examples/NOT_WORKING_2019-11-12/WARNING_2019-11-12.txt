   I moved the MARTINI examples to here and wrote this warning because
I noticed an inconsistency between MARTINI files from different sources.
I think this some of the 3body angles in these lipids are missing.

   To verify this, try running the "README_setup.sh" in these two directories:

DPPC_single
DPPC_single_explicit_ff

(or equilvalently run "cd moltemplate_files; moltemplate.sh system.lt")
Edit the "system.data" file generated in both cases.
Scroll down to the "Angles" section, and compare the number of angles generated.
The version that uses the "martini.lt" force field (located in "DPPC_single")
generates a "system.data" file which only contains 8 angles.
The original ITP file describing the DPPC lipid that I get directly from
the http://cgmartini.nl web site also contains only 8 angles.  See:
http://www.cgmartini.nl/images/parameters/lipids/PC/DPPC/martini_v2.0_DPPC_01.itp

   However the version manually created by Saeed Momeni Bashusqeh
(located in the "DPPC_single_explicit_ff" directory) has 11 angles.  Visually
speaking, this version (with 11 angles) looks and behaves much better.
(Specifically: The other DOPC and DPPC examples have an extremely sharp 
bend near the head group.  In the manual version, a stiff angular spring
at this location prevents this sharp bend from ocurring.)

   Which version is correct?
   If you know the answer, please contact me.

   Until the source of this discrepancy is resolved, I will leave these files
in this directory with this warning.
