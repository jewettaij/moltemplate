This directory contains an example of a couarse-grained (vaguely protein-like)
heteropolymer consisting of 14 residues, each of which has 2 atoms
(one backbone atom, one residue atom.)

There are two types of residues, H and P.
The R-atom for the H residue are attracted to eachother.
All other atoms are repulsive.

Instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.
