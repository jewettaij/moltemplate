# Description:
# 
# This example shows how to build a multicomponent spherical vesicle.
# The lipid bilayer is composed of two different lipids (DPPC and DLPC), 
# The vesicle contains 120 trans-membrane protein inclusions.
#
# The DPPC lipid model is described here:
#      G. Brannigan, P.F. Philips, and F.L.H. Brown,
#      Physical Review E, Vol 72, 011915 (2005)
# The protein model is described here:
#      G. Bellesia, AI Jewett, and J-E Shea, 
#      Protein Science, Vol19 141-154 (2010)
# The new DLPC model is a truncated version of DPPC, 
# (Its behaviour has not been rigorously tested.)
# Note that 50%/50% mixtures of DPPC & DLPC are commonly used to 
# build liposomes http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10620293
#
# NOTE: THE COORDINATES FOR THESE MOLECULES ARE GENERATED BY PACKMOL (see below)
# 
# NOTE:
#   This example may require additional features to be added to LAMMPS.
# If LAMMPS complains about an "Invalid pair_style", then copy the code
# in the "additional_lammps_code" directory into your LAMMPS "src" directory
# and recompile LAMMPS.

# First, load the definitions of the molecules we will need:

import "CGLipidBr2005.lt"
using namespace CGLipidBr2005

import "1beadProtSci2010.lt"
using namespace 1beadProtSci2010

# PREREQUISITES:
# Coordinates for the molecules in this example are loaded from an .XYZ file
# created by PACKMOL.  This must be done in advance.  (See ../packmol_files/)
#
# The XYZ file was created by PACKMOL in 3 steps:
# (Add the proteins, then pack lipids in the inner & outer layers around them.)
#
# step1) Creae 120 proteins.  Distribute them on the surface of the sphere.
#
# step2) Keeping the coordinates from step1 fixed, 
#     a) first we add 14000 DPPC lipids to the inner monolayer
#     b)  then we add 14000 DLPC lipids to the inner monolayer
#
# step3) Keeping the coordinates from steps 1 and 2 fixed, 
#     a) first we add 19000 DPPC lipids to the outer monolayer
#     b)  then we add 19000 DLPC lipids to the outer monolayer
#
# The order that molecules are created in moltemplate should match the order
# they appear in the final XYZ file created by PACKMOL.  (See above.)
# Consequently I instantiate the molecules in the same order here:


# Step 1)                   ---- protein inclusions ----

proteins = new 4HelixInsideOut [120]

# Step 2a)                  ---- inner monolayer ----
dppc_in = new DPPC [14000]
# Step 2b)
dlpc_in = new DLPC [14000]

# Step 3a)                  ---- outer monolayer ----
dppc_out = new DPPC [19000]
# Step 3b)
dlpc_out = new DLPC [19000]
