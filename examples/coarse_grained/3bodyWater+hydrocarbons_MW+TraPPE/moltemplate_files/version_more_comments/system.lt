  # -- This command says that the first atom type corresponds to the "mW"
  # -- atom in system.in.sw, and to ignore the remaining three atom types
  # -- (correspond to the CH2, CH3, CH4 atom types defined in trappe1998.lt.
  # --  We don't want to use the "sw" force field for interactions involving 
  # --  these atom types, so we put "NULL" there.)
  #
  # For this to work, the first atom type (assigned to "1")
  # must refer to the "mW" atom type (defined in watmw.lt). 
  # (This is why we included "watmw.lt" first, to insure that the
  #  atom counters in WatMW are assinged first, starting with 1.)
  # Alternately we can further insure that this happens, it's
  # a good idea to run moltemplate.sh using the "-a" argument:
  #     moltemplate.sh -a "@atom:/WatMW/mW 1" system.lt
  # This assigns the atom type named @atom:/WatMW/mW to 1

#    3.166. As a crude guess, I chose the LJ parameters for the interaction 
#    between water & the CH2,CH3,CH4 atoms using Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules
