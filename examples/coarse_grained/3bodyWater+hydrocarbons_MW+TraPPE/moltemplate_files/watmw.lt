# This file stores LAMMPS data for the "mW" water model.
# (Molinero, V. and Moore, E.B., J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 4008-4016)
#
# In this model, each water molecule is represented by a single "mW" particle.
# These particles interact with their neighbors via 3-body Stillinger-Weber 
# forces whose parameters are tuned to mimic directional hydrogen-bonding
# in liquid water (as well as hexagonal ice, type II ice, and
# low-density super-cooled liquid/amorphous water phases).

####
# 
# NOTE: THIS FILE IS INTENDED FOR SIMULATIONS OF WATER MIXED WITH HYDROCARBONS.
#       IN THIS EXAMPLE THERE 3 TYPES OF ATOMS USED TO REPRESENT HYDROCARBONS.
#       IF YOU HAVE 2 TYPES OF ATOMS IN YOUR SYSTEM (for example),
#       YOU MUST REPLACE THIS LINE:
#
#   pair_coeff * * sw system.in.sw mW NULL NULL NULL #<-(mW, 3 OTHER ATOM TYPES)
#
#       WITH THIS LINE:
#
#   pair_coeff * * sw system.in.sw mW NULL NULL      #<-(mW, 2 OTHER ATOM TYPES)
#
#       ...IN THE FILE BELOW.
#
#   (Note:The number of "NULL" entries in the list should match the
#         number of other atom types defined somewhere in your simulation.
#         In the "3bodyWater+hydrocarbons_MW+TraPPE" example, there are 3 
#         types of carbon defined in "trappe1998.lt", so "NULL" appears 3 times.
