# which ones we need. This information belongs in the "In Init" section (and
# (you can specify it anywhere in your LT files, multiple times if you like).
# If different molecules use different force-field styles, you can use hybrid
# styles.  (In this example the molecules share the same pair_style.)

#
# In this example we deleted solvent and wall molecule objects.
# You can also delete a monomer inside the polymer.  To do that use:
#   delete polymer/monomers[6]
# You can also delete individual atoms, bonds, angles, dihedrals, & impropers
# from existing molecules.  For example to delete an atom in the middle 
# of the polymer try this.  (Bonds and other interactions will also be removed.)
#   delete polymer/monomers[6]/CA
# To delete a bond, try this
#   delete polymer/bb6
# Note: This will not delete the angular interactions if they were explicitly
#       defined (ie, using "Data Angles" instead of "Data Angles By Type").
#       Delete explicit angle, dihedral, and improper interactions manually.
# Note: In both cases the two molecule fragments will keep the same mol counter.
