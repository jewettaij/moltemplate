This example contains a (crude and somewhat simple) example of
the translocation of a (rather short) polymer through a hole in a wall,
surrounded by an explicit LJ solvent.

(I used a short polymer because a longer polymer would require a larger box.
 But this example looked more impressive visually when I used a smaller box.)
----
Note: You must compile LAMMPS with the optional "RIGID" package installed. To
      do this, go to the "src" directory of your lammps installation and type:
      make yes-RIGID
      make clean-all
      make NAME_OF_TARGET   #<--("make ubuntu", "make g++", "make linux".)

Instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.
