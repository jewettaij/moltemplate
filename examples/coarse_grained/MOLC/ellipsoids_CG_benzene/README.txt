# CG model of benzene where each molecule is represented as an ellipsoid
# and the intermolecular interactions are described with the Gay-Berne potential
#
# Do not expect realistic behaviour from this example.
# The long-range electrostatic interactions are missing.
#
# To build the files which LAMMPS needs, follow the instructions in
# README_setup.sh
#
# To run the simulation in LAMMPS, follow the instructions in:
# README_run.sh
#
# Finally, to view the simulation results in OVITO, follow the instructions in:
# README_visualization_OVITO.txt
# README_visualization_OVITO_ellipsoids.png

#
# This example was provided by Otello M. Roscion (U.Southampton)
# and Matteo Ricci(U.Bologna)  Many thanks for editing and debugging
# moltemplate code to get this working!
