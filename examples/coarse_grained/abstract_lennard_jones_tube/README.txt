This example demonstrates how to build a simple system
containing mobile and immobile atoms using moltemplate.
An immobile tube is constructed of Lennard Jones particles (see "system.lt")
interacting with a fluid composed of (similar sized) Lennard Jones particles.

Instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.
