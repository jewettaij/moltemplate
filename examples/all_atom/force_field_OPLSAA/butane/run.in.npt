#     You must use moltemplate.sh to create 4 files:

#     (Follow the instructions in README_setup.sh, 
#      or run the file as a script using ./README_setup.sh)

# To avoid explosions, I have a 4-step equilibraion process (expand, minimize, 
# reorient, compress).  The system (as defined in the "system.data" file) 
# is already expanded.  That means there are 3 steps left:

# -- equilibration part 3: Equilibrating the density (NPT) --

# Originally, the simulation box (in "system.data" and "system.lt") was 
# unrealistically large.  The spacing between the molecules was large also.
# I did this to enable the molecules to move freely and reorient themselves.
# After doing that, we should run the simulation under NPT conditions to 
# allow the simulation box to contract to it's natural size.
# To help it collapse, we begin the simulation at a relatively high pressure
# Later on, we will slowly decrease it to 1 bar.

# First cool the system. (Do this at high pressure to avoid bubble formation.)
