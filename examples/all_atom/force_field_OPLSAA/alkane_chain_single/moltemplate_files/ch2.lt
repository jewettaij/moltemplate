# Optional: Shift all the coordinates in the +Y direction by 0.4431163.
#           This way, the carbon atom is no longer located at 0,0,0, but the
#           axis of an alkane chain containing this monomer is at 0,0,0.
#           (This makes it more convenient to construct a polymer later.
#            If this is confusing, then simply add 0.4431163 to the Y 
#            coordinates in the "Data Atoms" section above.)
