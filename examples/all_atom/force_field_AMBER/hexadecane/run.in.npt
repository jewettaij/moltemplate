# PREREQUISITES:
#
#     You must use moltemplate.sh to create 3 files:
#        system.data  system.in.init  system.in.settings
#     (Follow the instructions in README_setup.sh, 
#      or run the file as a script using ./README_setup.sh)

# ------------------------------- Initialization Section --------------------

include         system.in.init


# Weird LAMMPS issue:
# The "system.in.init" file contains definitions for bond, angle, dihedral,
# and improper interactions that were defined in the AMBER/GAFF2 force-field.
# But since the molecules in this example do not have any improper interactions,
# LAMMPS will crash.  To get around this, tell LAMMPS to disable all
# improper interactions:

improper_style none


# ------------------------------- Atom Definition Section -------------------

read_data       system.data

# ------------------------------- Settings Section --------------------------

# ------------------------------- Run Section -------------------------------

# Explanation.
# Unless you use packmol (or some other geometry generation program),
# the initial geometry created by moltemplate using a lattice is
# extremely unrealistic for a liquid, and likely to put the system
# a kinetic trap (local minimum). So this example uses high temperatures
# to completely obliterate any memory of that initial lattice shape.
# Then it uses a combination of high pressures and cooling to bring
# the system back down to a temperature and density of a liquid at 1atm, 300K.

# I am using a 4-step equilibraion process (expand, minimize,
# reorient, compress).  The system (as defined in the "system.data" file) 
# is already expanded.  That means there are 3 steps left:

# Note: In general, it's always a good idea to minimize the system at first.

# Run the system at high temperature (at constant volume) to reorient the
# the molecules (which would otherwise be pointing in the same direction).

# To speed it up, I randomize the atomic positions for a few thousand steps 
# using fix langevin (and fix nve).  Then I switch to fix nvt (Nose-Hoover).
# (If I start with fix nvt (Nose-Hoover), it seems to get "stuck" for a while.)

# -- equilibration part 3: Equilibrating the density (NPT) --

# Originally, the simulation box (in "system.data" and "system.lt") was 
# unrealistically large.  The spacing between the molecules was large also.
# I did this to enable the molecules to move freely and reorient themselves.
# After doing that, we should run the simulation under NPT conditions to 
# allow the simulation box to contract to it's natural size.  We do that here:
# We begin the simulation at 100 atm (a relatively low pressure), and
# slowly decrease it to 1 atm, maintianing the temperature at 300K.
