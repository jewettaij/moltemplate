import "gaff2.lt"    # <-- defines the "GAFF2" force field


# The "gaff2.lt" file is usually located in $MOLTEMPLATE_PATH (and is 
# distributed with moltemplate. See the "Installation" section in the manual.)
# It contains definitions of the "@atom:c3", "@atom:hc", atoms as well as the
# force-field parameters for bonded and non-bonded interactions between them 
# (and many other atoms).

# WARNING: CHARGES ARE INCORRECT
# For this example, I manually looked up the charge of each atom using the 
# OPLSAA parameters from the "oplsaa.prm" file distributed with TINKER:
# http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/distribution/params/oplsaa.prm
#  ----->  DO NOT DO THIS!  <-----
# Normally simulations in AMBER are assigned charges using the
# "HF/6-31G* RESP2" or "AM1-BCC3" methods using AmberTools.
# Using the OPLSAA charges instead will NOT reproduce the behavior of AMBER.
# For more details how to calculate charges correctly, see:
# https://github.com/jewettaij/moltemplate/blob/master/examples/all_atom/force_field_AMBER/README.md

  #  Note: The "..." in "$mol:..." tells moltemplate that this molecule may
  #        be a part of a larger molecule, and (if so) to use the larger
  #        parent object's molecule id number as it's own.
  #        The CH2 group is part of the Hexadecane molecule.

  # Now specify which pairs of atoms are bonded:

} # CH2


# Optional: Shift all the coordinates in the +Y direction by 0.4431163.
#           This way, the carbon atom is no longer located at 0,0,0, but the
#           axis of an alkane chain containing this monomer is at 0,0,0.
#           (This makes it more convenient to construct a polymer later.
#            If this is confusing, then simply add 0.4431163 to the Y 
#            coordinates in the "Data Atoms" section above.)
