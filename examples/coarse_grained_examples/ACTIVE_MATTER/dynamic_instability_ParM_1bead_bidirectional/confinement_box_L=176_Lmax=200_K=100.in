# This sets the parameter "rc0" equal to 100.0.
# This is the distance of the wall from the origin.
# Particles will experience an inward pushing force earlier than this(see below)

# Now apply an inward force applied to every particle which lies outside
# a region (of at position rc0-rc from the origin)
# The energy of each particle (due to that force) is:
#
# Uexternal(r) = k*(rsurf-rc)^2
