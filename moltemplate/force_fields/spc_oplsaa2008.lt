# This is the version of the SPC water model suitable for use in a simulation
# using the OPLSAA force field (as implemented in the "oplsaa2008.lt" file).
#
# Note: This is not the same as the SPC/E water model.
#
# Both water models (SPC and SPC/E) are described in this paper:
#   Berendsen, Grigera, Straatsma, J Phys Chem, 91, 6269-6271 (1987)
#
# Note: This file was intended for use in a simulation that uses the OPLSAA
# force field.  This is different from the other water models included with
# moltemplate (eg. "spce.lt", "tip3p_2004.lt").  Those files explicitly include
# the the force-field parameters and bond geometry in the file itself.  This
# makes it easier to use those files in simulations that use other force fields.
# However that kind of information was omitted from this file.  Instead the
# force field parameters and bond geometry are defined in the "oplsaa2008.lt" file.
