# This file contains an implementation of the SPC/E water model which is
# comptabile with OPLS-related force fields.
#
# Note: This file was intended for use in a simulation that uses the OPLSAA
# force field.  This is different from the other water models included with
# moltemplate (eg. "spce.lt", "tip3p_2004.lt").  Those files explicitly include
# the the force-field parameters and bond geometry in the file itself.  This
# makes it easier to use those files in simulations that use other force fields.
# However that kind of information was omitted from this file.  Instead the
# force field parameters and bond geometry are defined in the "oplsaa2024.lt" file.

write_once("WARNING_PLEASE_USE_spce_oplsaa2024.lt_INSTEAD.TXT") {
  Both the "spce_oplsaa.lt" and "oplsaa.lt" files are being deprecated
  and will be removed soon.  So in the future, please use
  "import spce_oplsaa2024.lt" and "import oplsaa2024.lt" (instead of
  "import spce_oplsaa.lt" and "import oplsaa.lt") in all of your .lt files.

  Why? All future versions of the OPLSAA force field will
  be given unique file names (eg "oplsaa2008.lt", "oplsaa2024.lt").
  This will protect users from future changes in the @atom type numbers
  (which vary according to the version).
  This affects the SPCE molecule type too, since this version uses OPLSAA.
